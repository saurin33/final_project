review
Fruity aroma on the nose which made me think it was going to be a fruity tasting beer but in actuality it was more nutty in flavor. Medium bodied but smooth
I don't typically like stouts but decided to try this one anyways. The head was too thick for my liking but once I tasted the beer it was not at all bitter like I think most stouts are
"Pils are my favorite beer so I'm sorry to say that this one just didn't cut it for me. It left an aftertaste that I just didn't like. It was light as it should be, I just didn't care for the flavor"
"Pours very dark brown with a small short-lasting, off-white head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, dark fruits roasted malt, nut, ash and a touch of manure. Medium sweetness and light roasted bitterness. Light to moderate body, average carbonation. Sweet mocha milk shake float finish. Prefer it from cask."
Peach juice colour. Bubbly head. Aroma is raspberry and rhubarb. Taste is mostly raspberry and strawberry.
"Hazy golden colour. Aroma is grassy with some cereal. Taste is cereal, lemon zest, and herbs. Crisp."
"Very clear, pale amber nearing lemon. Only small white line for head. Pleasant flowery, grassy aroma. Thin tasting, mild citrus. Easy drinking - ok beer."
"The beer is a hazy copper-red color with a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly to a film. Sparse strings of lace. Aroma of tropical fruit, wheat and malt. Light to medium body with flavors of pineapple, vanilla, wheat and biscuit malt. The finish is mildly tart and creamy with a tropical fruit aftertaste. Pretty good overall."
"I'm not much of a stout guy buy enjoyed the 2020 version of this. It is strong with the coffee and the chocolate notes and has the slight basil and licoricey notes common to this type of stouts, really pronounced in the Founders line. The thing I like most about this is that it lacks that medicine/astringent aftertaste that many barrel aged stouts have."
"Interesting pour to this as it had a blueberry hue with a good amount of light seeping in around the extreme edges with a violet-coffee head topping this off. That was quite fine and long-lasting as it offset the liquid quite nicely. Loads of funky, earthy blueberry in the nose along with feet, Mosaic dankness, and fruit patch as the sugary, sweet jam and exotic, mountainous coffee emerged in the taste and threw me for a bit of a loop. A very subtle and persistent chocolatey undertone and growing homemade jammy sweetness combined to make this quite complex and conflicting on the palate as it took me a while to warm up to this, as this fully warmed up."
"Pours a clear, brilliant deep honey gold body topped with multiple fingers of pillowy, eggshell white foam; great head retention yields a chunky cap, moderate, frothy collar, and a comprehensive spatter of webby/spotty, soapy lacing around the glass."
Lemon/orange scent with malt up front and bit of dry dank to finish. Bit of black pepper spice and becomes more lemony than orange. I like this better than 2019's...
"Looks like every other New England IPA, with hazy, golden body. The head was just about one finger thick at its peak. The aroma was quite clean, with primarily grapefruit and tangerine. The taste was citric, with grapefruit and lemon up front, followed by pith like bitterness. The mouthfeel was soft, and the finish a little spicy. Alcohol was well hidden."
"Clear light amber, sudsy bone white cap. Cereal grains, light toasted note, mildly grassy and floral. Taste: pale malt sweetness, honey bread, clean lemony and barely piney hopping. Light+ body, crisp-ish finish. A more hopped and slightly more flavorful take."
"Hazy pale yellow pour with a large white head on top. Great sticky lacing also. The smell of the Nelson and Citra blend well together. The taste has a juicy hop flavor to it, subtle tangerine notes in the finish. The feel is pillowy soft and smooth. Overall, it's a very nice beer."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours golden yellow with a small white head. Smells of sweet grain, fuller than most adjuncts, but still plain. Tastes of sweet grain with just a hint of bitterness from the hops. Beer is light bodied and very easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a good beer."
"This one shifts in flavor compared to the aroma. I still get heavy and tart raspberry, but it’s more so a dry pear character backed with light malt, cherry, and lemon. Quite tart almost to the point of being overwhelming."
"Pours a deep jet-brown body highlighting mahogany-amber accents at both ends and is topped with two fingers of creamy, dark khaki foam; good head retention leaves a thin, rocky cap, lightly frothy collar, and dense rings of lacing holding firm to the walls of the glass. Aroma persists on a foundation of intensely balanced roast accented with a vague minerality upfront; charred wood sparks hints of fresh chocolate through the middle, while exceptionally balanced touches of bready sweetness appear as the bouquet fades to burnt coffee grounds and grassy hops on the close."
"I always thought this was one of the better Chelada style beers, with Modelo being the exception. I wish they had not discontinued it because I would by it frequently for its lime and salt flavor, which was great on hot days. Plus, it seemed to have a slight tequila flavour to it, which may have thrown a few people off. The look was just fine, smell, I thought had that hint of lime and tequila aroma. Same with the taste, different from other lime beers, and I preferred that, and the feel was just fine, it went down great, maybe too good. I can tell you, chase a shot of tequila with this beer, and you are good to go!"
"Picked-up a case of cans at Bradford's in Plymouth for eighty six dollars. This is a decent enough beer, but certainly not worth $86/case. I have found each of the Fiddlehead brews that I have had to be overpriced, & underwhelming."
"Danky IPA with the smell of straight up weed. Tastes very similar to the smell. What can I say, high abv, and liquid weed, just what you need to relax and chill."
